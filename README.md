# CapstoneProject - FoodTruckLocator

An app that allows a user to see all local food trucks, the food truck’s location, and will be routed to google maps for directions.

This app will have two interfaces - one for the public user (User), the other for the food truck owners/representative (Truck).

<i>Interface 1 (User)</i>: The user will have to register/login. The landing page will have a static map with icons to indicate the food truck locations. When a user clicks on the icon, a view page of the food truck’s information (logo, menu, hours of operation, phone number, location schedule, reviews left by other users, etc.), and a link to the food truck’s location. The user will have their own account page to view their information (profile photo, favorites, reviews, etc.). I will be using MapQuest API for the static map as well as the geocoding for food truck locations. With the geo-coordinates, I will have a link to redirect the user to google maps for directions to said location.

<i>Interface 2 (Truck)</i>: The truck will have a register/login separate from the user. The truck will register the above listed information. In their account, they will have access to update their location at any point. Or, they can allow the app to update their location based on the schedule provided.
